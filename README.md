# Would You Rather ?

This is the second project in Advanced Front-End Web Nanodegree Program by Udacity.

The aim is to use React and Redux  to build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game.

 This is basically a voting app in which user can create or answer with two options.
The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. In the app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Installation

- install all project dependencies with yarn install.
- start the development server with yarn start.
- ccess the app on <http://localhost:3000/>

## Technologies used

- React
- Redux toolKit
- React Router
- React-Bootstrap

## Important

As the app works with a pseudo backend server, there is no data persistence and hence, any new questions or answers will be lost by performing a browser refresh.

### `Backend Server`

Currently _DATA.js file is used to mock backend.
